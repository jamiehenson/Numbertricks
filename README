So far, this program can find these things about a number:
- its factors
- whether it is a perfect number
- the primes that come before it
- how many primes come before it
- whether it is prime itself
- its product of primes representation (optimised)
- whether it is a triangular number
- whether it is a square number
- whether it is part of the Fibonacci sequence
- the factorial version of it

Next on the list:
- whether it is part of next week's lottery numbers
